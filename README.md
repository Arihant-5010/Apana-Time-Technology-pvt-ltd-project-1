Data Analyst Project: Exploratory Data Analysis using Python, SQL, Excel & Dashboard with Apann Time Technolgy pvt ltd
🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow using Python, SQL, and Excel, followed by the development of an interactive dashboard for intuitive data visualization. The analysis is based on the dataset provided in Data set.xlsx.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)

SQL (via SQLite/PostgreSQL or your preferred DBMS)

Microsoft Excel

Power BI / Streamlit / Plotly Dash (for dashboard visualization)

✅ Project Steps
📌 Step 1: Python Code using Data set.xlsx
Performed EDA using Python to calculate:

Measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, Mode

Measures of dispersion: Variance, Standard Deviation, Range

Skewness (asymmetry of data)

Kurtosis (tailedness of data distribution)



📌 Step 2: SQL Code using Data set.xlsx
Converted the Excel data into a SQL-compatible format and used SQL queries to compute:

Mean, Median, Mode

Variance, Standard Deviation

Skewness, Kurtosis (using mathematical approximations)



📌 Step 3: Excel Analysis
Opened the dataset in Excel and used built-in functions to calculate:

=AVERAGE(), =MEDIAN(), =MODE()

=VAR.P(), =STDEV.P(), =MAX()-MIN() (Range)

=SKEW() and =KURT() for skewness and kurtosis



📌 Step 4: Interactive Dashboard
Created an interactive dashboard that allows users to:

Select variables/columns

View distribution plots (histograms, boxplots, etc.)

Observe live calculations of statistical metrics


🧠 Key Insights
Insightful visualizations and statistics were derived to better understand the data distribution and variability.
