**Data Analyst Project**: Exploratory Data Analysis using Python, SQL, Excel & Dashboard with Apana Time Technolgy pvt ltd

** Overview**
This project demonstrates a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow using Python, SQL, and Excel, followed by the development of an interactive dashboard for intuitive data visualization. The analysis is based on the dataset provided in Data set.xlsx.

** Tools & Technologies**
**Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)**

**SQL** 

**Microsoft Excel**

Power BI  / Plotly Dash (for dashboard visualization)

** Project Steps**
**Step 1**: **Python Code** using Data set.xlsx
Performed EDA using Python to calculate:

Measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, Mode

Measures of dispersion: Variance, Standard Deviation, Range

Skewness (asymmetry of data)

Kurtosis (tailedness of data distribution)



** Step 2**:** SQL Code** using Data set.xlsx
 SQL queries to compute:

Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation , Skewness, Kurtosis (using mathematical approximations)



📌** Step 3**: **Excel Analysis**
Opened the dataset in Excel and used built-in functions to calculate:

=AVERAGE(), =MEDIAN(), =MODE()

=VAR.P(), =STDEV.P(), =MAX()-MIN() (Range)

=SKEW() and =KURT() for skewness and kurtosis



**Step 4**: **Interactive Dashboard**
Created an interactive dashboard that allows users to:

Select variables/columns

View distribution plots (histograms, boxplots, etc.)

Observe live calculations of statistical metrics


🧠 Key Insights
Insightful visualizations and statistics were derived to better understand the data distribution and variability.
